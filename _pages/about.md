I am currently a master’s student in artificial intelligence at the University of Hong Kong, having fulfilled all the coursework requirements and working on my final project (capstone). My expected graduation date is January 2024, and **I am seeking potential opportunities for pursuing a PhD degree**. 


My undergraduate background is in mathematics and applied mathematics from Chongqing University, where I gained extensive knowledge in statistics and advanced theoretical mathematics. I also participated and won awards in various mathematical contests and math modeling competitions during my bachelor’s studies. I declined the recommendation for graduate admission and chose to study artificial intelligence at the University of Hong Kong for my master’s degree, with the aim of applying my mathematical skills to computer research.


Throughout my master’s program, I have acquired knowledge of various models, and I have been keen to expand my understanding of different research domains. As a result, I have not yet decided on a specific research topic for my PhD, but I am confident that my mathematical and research abilities will make me a qualified candidate. I aspire to pursue a research direction that can leverage my solid mathematical foundation
