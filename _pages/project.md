* Computer Vision: 2023.3
  
   I participated in a computer vision project for autonomous driving, where I developed a network for object detection. The network utilized ResNet as the backbone and YOLO as the detection head. I optimized the network training process and achieved satisfactory results, significantly enhancing my knowledge and skills in the field of computer vision and autonomous driving.
  
* Natural Language Model: 2023.5
  
  I participated in the development and fine-tuning of an Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) model, gaining a deep understanding of the challenges and methods involved in open-domain question answering. I utilized the pre-trained language model BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to build the question answering model and fine-tuned it to extract answers from relevant documents. This experience enhanced my knowledge and skills in natural language processing and question answering, as I became familiar with the construction and fine-tuning process of the BERT model.

* Assessment of COVID-19 based on infectious disease dynamics models. 2018.5
  
  Proposed a modified infectious disease model to study the spread of infectious diseases based on the traditional SEIR models, focusing on the continuous importation of infected individuals. Calculated the basic reproduction number to assess the control measures for foreign infected cases. Fitted the model to three cities, identifing decision-making timelines for implementing regional control measures.




* Graph Theory and Anomaly Detection Algorithm to Solve Problem D in 2021 MCM/ICM
  
  By mining the existing data, we used graph theory to build an influence network graph, taking directed edge to connect each node according to the influence relationship. Additionally, using the graph theory algorithms, we calculated the indicators to evaluate the importance of node in the network map. A neural network-based multi-dimensional time series anomaly detection algorithm was utilized to calculate the years when the overall music characteristics changed significantly. We compared the years of significant changes in each musical characteristic with the overall metric to find the revolutionary years and compared the nodes’ influence to find dynamic nodes in the time sequence.

* Differential Equations, Curve Symmetry Difference and Optimal Value Algorithm to Solve the Heat Conduction Model in 2020 CUMCM Problem A
  
  We listed the ordinary differential equations according to Fourier's law of heat conduction and Newton's law of cooling, and then used Python to bring in actual data to solve. We also utilized the least square estimation method to find the optimal solution. In solving the last question, the curve symmetry difference was deployed as the objective function, and the optimization method was employed to find the value of the indices with the best curve symmetry.
