Master：
====
As part of my master’s program in artificial intelligence at the University of Hong Kong, I have completed seven core courses and three electives in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. I enrolled in four courses in my first semester and six courses in my second semester. You can find more details about these courses on my course page. Since the summer of 2023, I have been concentrating on my research activities and my capstone project. 


During my second semester, I had the opportunity to work with an assistant professor from HKU on a research project that involved collecting self-reported data on COVID-19 infections from online sources, and analyzing and estimating the prevalence of COVID-19 in mainland China. My main role was to develop data crawlers to gather comments from users on Douyin about their symptoms, and to suggest a regional approach to measure the COVID-19 situation for each province. 


My capstone project focuses on enhancing NLP with GNN models. I aim to improve the performance of NLP algorithms by incorporating GNN networks. Alternatively, I could explore the interpretability of NLP models using GNNs. 


I am currently working as a part-time research assistant in the Department of Computer Science at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, focusing on the Joye-Libert Cryptosystem.

Undergraduate：
====

I have always been passionate about mathematics since high school, when I won the second prize in the provincial high school mathematics competition in Henan Province. In college, I continued to excel in mathematics and received the third prize in the national undergraduate mathematics competition. From my sophomore year, I participated in mathematical modeling competitions and achieved the national second prize in the National Mathematical Modeling Competition in 2021 and the M prize in the American Mathematical Modeling Competition. These experiences sparked my interest in mathematical modeling and computer-based problem solving, which motivated me to decline my recommendation for graduate admission and apply for a master’s degree at the University of Hong Kong instead
